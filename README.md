# HPC-Parallel-Optimization

## Overview

Welcome to my project repository for **HPC-Parallel-Optimization**! In this project, I explore the optimization of data structures in High-Performance Computing (HPC) by leveraging parallel computation techniques. Specifically, I implement and compare serial and parallel versions of the sum-of-squares calculation. While the task itself is simple, it serves as a great starting point to demonstrate how parallelism can improve performance, especially in larger and more complex computational tasks.

The project uses Python’s `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the sum-of-squares calculation. I’ll compare the performance of the serial and parallel approaches, focusing on the speedup achieved when using parallelism in a simple computational task.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To implement a **serial sum-of-squares** computation and assess its performance.
2. To implement a **parallel sum-of-squares** computation using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` and evaluate its performance.
3. To **compare the execution times** of both approaches and calculate the performance improvement.
4. To analyze the results, discuss the implications of parallel computing, and reflect on the challenges and lessons learned.

This project serves as an introduction to how parallel computing can be applied to optimize simple algorithms in HPC.
